#Titanic Visualizaiton
This project work visualizes Titanic survival based on passenger information such as gender and cabin class.
-Various visual encodings have been utilized such as color, stacked bar, and proportion & absolute numbers for values. 
-Also it incorporates both author-driven narratives and reader-driven exploration through use of button press to make transitions & tooltip to make the plots more interactive.

###Summary:
This bar chart stacks the percentage and absolute number of passengers survived or dead during the tragic sink.
It can be seen that gender is the dominant driver for suvival. Women have much higher chance than men to survive in every cabin class. 
In terms of cabin calss, generally speaking, passengers in first class have much higher chance to survive than those in second & third class.

###Below is the link to take a look at the visualization.
